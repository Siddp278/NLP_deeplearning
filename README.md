# NLP_deeplearning

##Some common preprocessing steps for the language models include:
###**Audio_sentiment**
We are using `Speech Recognizer` Package to convert the audio clipping to text, from there on we are using naive bayes model(predicting the most probable word-sentiment) to train that model for sentiment analysis on that text. The `Sentiment_analysis_naive` has the implementation of the naive bayes model. Have included the `pickle` files so that you dont have to train the model again and again.

###- **Autocorrect System**


###- **split text to list of sentences**

###- **split sentence into list words**
