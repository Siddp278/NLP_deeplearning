Document_Vectors

This is a sub-repo holding codes for implementation of document vectors to find the similarity in the text for different documents.
Here, some important aspects are missing(as in the data to train the model: vector formation from words since I'm using word2vec), since the file size exceeds what github lets
you store for free, some directives are given in here as to gain the access to the data and how to use that data in the code:

From the above site you can take the word embeddings and download them, I used the Stanford Word Embeddings GLOVE

The code is then given from which you can take help to convert the text file into word2vec file which is used by the model.
